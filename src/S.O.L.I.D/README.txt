S.O.L.I.D
-----------------
1. Single responsiblity principles
2. Open closed principles
3. Liskov subtitution principles
4. Interface segregation principles
5. Dependecies Inversion principles.

Rules:
----------------------
Single responsiblity principles: 'Only one reason to change' Means if we are changing the
the function/ class values or propeties there will be only one reason not too many.

Open closed principles: 'Entities are open for extenstion but closed for modification'.
this means we can extend the function/class/modules but do not modify the internal logic.
So in React HOC is the best example of this principles.
