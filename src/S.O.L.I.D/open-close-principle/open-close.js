/* Problem:
* Let suppose we have different data and thier lenghth and values(properties are 
 * different: ex:
 * customerA = {name,address};
 * customerB = {name,address, phone}
 * customerC = {name, phone, email}
 * Now if we create CustomerDetail component and display by passing the data with
 * different component like
 * <CustomerDetail data={customerA}>
 * <CustomerDetail data={customerB}>
 * <CustomerDetail data={customerC}>
 * and changing and adding the value in CustomerDetails conditionaly that will
 * complex our code and there is lots of modification in internal logic.
 * So its voilating the OSP(open closed principles rule)
